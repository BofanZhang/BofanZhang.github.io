      <h2>The Renaissance</h2>
      <p>
        The period that moved into the age of enlightenment, the Renaissance was a movement by writers, philosophers, scientists, and poets to embrace
        reason over faith. Many people all over europe began to question the church's and monarch's legitimacy, and unrest grew into critical
        documents and writings that are still used today. People like Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, and Rousseau, began to write in opposition or at least
        better management of the Monarch's reign. This era is probably one of the biggest increases in reason there is, suddenly jumping from entirely
        faith to slightly more reason than faith in the average populace. Many ideas and theories are still held from this era, and those that don't
        are still the building blocks for modern science today.

      <h2>The Scientific Revolution</h2>
      <p class="text4">
        The scientific revolution was a period of significant change in the scientific method and reasoning. It took place during the 16th and 17th
        centuries. It replaced the old scientific view on natural sciences which was based on the Ancient Greeks which had dominated the field for
        around 2000 years. During this time, people began to ask more questions about the world around them which led to more answers as people began
        to find answers to their questions. While seeking for answers, many began to use the same method inorder to get similar answers, which led to
        the development of the scientific method which we still use today.
      </p>
      <p class="text4">
        The Scientific Revolution challenged traditional Christian beliefs about the origins of the universe and the natural world, leading to a
        conflict between Science and Religion. However, it is important to remember that religion and science can exist at the same time and that one
        is not “better” than the other. For example, Nicolaus Copernicus served the Catholic Church as an official but still had the freedom to
        conduct scientific research at the same time which led him to create the heliocentric system. While religion played a role in shaping
        scientific thought, it was reason and physical evidence that drove the scientific revolution.

      <h2>Christianity</h2>
      <p>
        Christianity is an abrahamic religion born around the primary belief that Jesus Christ is the messiah & son of god. Though the religion has
        garnered many different sects, orders, and several main groups including Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodoxy, and Restorationism. All of
        them involve the common throughline of belief in god through Jesus and some form of bible. Whilst the words that were actually said by Jesus
        include a lot of beliefs through reason, a fair majority of what he said was words of faith, and Christianity throughout the years became the
        biggest influence of faith in the European world.

      <h2>Feudalism/Medieval Ages</h2>
      <p>
        The medieval period can be quantified timeline-wise into the rise & fall of the Byzantine empire. Beginning in 476 when the western roman
        empire fell, and ending ~3-50 years after the Byzantine's loss of constantinople, and thus, the empire. During this period there was a
        significant loss of reason in Europe, though other sections of the world (Specifically Asia) were not as heavily affected by this era. (Reason
        does not mean technology, and there were actually significant developments in this era) It's difficult to overstate how much church dominated
        and abused its power during this time and this was also when Feudalism was the usual way lords and kings reigned over their land. With the
        population separated into 4 different classes, (commoners, knights, clergy/nobles, and monarchs) life was painful, and the only solace people
        found was faith in god and belief that they would go to heaven. This is thus the period of the most significant faith and the least reason.

      <h2>The Black Death</h2>
      <p>
        The bubonic plague (Also known as the black death, at the time) was the most significant spread of a fatal disease in human history, and the
        death toll was to the point where it's possible that ½ of people died. (Other estimates place this at ⅓, or ⅕, but it's generally hard to
        determine.) This event took place from roughly 1346-1353, and was probably the time period for the most faith over reason in the world. As the
        already superstitious and devout people of Europe then started to believe the plague was an act of god, almost entirely leaving reason out of
        the equation. Through this plague, the church probably got to the most powerful it ever had been, and the Reign of feudalism was even stronger
        during this time. The plague still existed after these years and into today, technically, but it was much less significant then during this
        time period.
