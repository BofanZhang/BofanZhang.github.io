      <h2>The Renaissance</h2>
      <p>
        The period that moved into the age of enlightenment, the Renaissance was
        a movement by writers, philosophers, scientists, and poets to embrace
        reason over faith. Many people all over europe began to question the
        church's and monarch's legitimacy, and unrest grew into critical
        documents and writings that are still used today. People like Thomas
        Hobbes, Voltaire, and Rousseau, began to write in opposition or at least
        better management of the Monarch's reign. This era is probably one of
        the biggest increases in reason there is, suddenly jumping from entirely
        faith to slightly more reason than faith in the average populace. Many
        ideas and theories are still held from this era, and those that don't
        are still the building blocks for modern science today.

      <h2>Christianity</h2>
      <p>
        Christianity is an abrahamic religion born around the primary belief
        that Jesus Christ is the messiah & son of god. Though the religion has
        garnered many different sects, orders, and several main groups including
        Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodoxy, and Restorationism. All of them
        involve the common throughline of belief in god through Jesus and some
        form of bible. Whilst the words that were actually said by Jesus include
        a lot of beliefs through reason, a fair majority of what he said was
        words of faith, and Christianity throughout the years became the biggest
        influence of faith in the European world.

      <h2>Feudalism/Medieval Ages</h2>
      <p>
        The medieval period can be quantified timeline-wise into the rise & fall
        of the Byzantine empire. Beginning in 476 when the western roman empire
        fell, and ending ~3-50 years after the Byzantine's loss of
        constantinople, and thus, the empire. During this period there was a
        significant loss of reason in Europe, though other sections of the world
        (Specifically Asia) were not as heavily affected by this era. (Reason
        does not mean technology, and there were actually significant
        developments in this era) It's difficult to overstate how much church
        dominated and abused its power during this time and this was also when
        Feudalism was the usual way lords and kings reigned over their land.
        With the population separated into 4 different classes, (commoners,
        knights, clergy/nobles, and monarchs) life was painful, and the only
        solace people found was faith in god and belief that they would go to
        heaven. This is thus the period of the most significant faith and the
        least reason.

      <h2>The Black Death</h2>
      <p>
        The bubonic plague (Also known as the black death, at the time) was the
        most significant spread of a fatal disease in human history, and the
        death toll was to the point where it's possible that ½ of people died.
        (Other estimates place this at ⅓, or ⅕, but it's generally hard to
        determine.) This event took place from roughly 1346-1353, and was
        probably the time period for the most faith over reason in the world. As
        the already superstitious and devout people of Europe then started to
        believe the plague was an act of god, almost entirely leaving reason out
        of the equation. Through this plague, the church probably got to the
        most powerful it ever had been, and the Reign of feudalism was even
        stronger during this time. The plague still existed after these years
        and into today, technically, but it was much less significant then
        during this time period.
