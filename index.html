      <h2>Ancient Egyptians 3100 B.C.E</h2>
      <p class="text1">
        The ancient Egyptians were an advanced civilization that was established along the Nile River. While the Egyptians made many important
        contributions to human civilization, their influence on Europeans was indirect and happened more through the general spread of Egyptian
        culture and knowledge. Some of the ways Egyptians contributed to the development of rational thinking in Europe were through their early
        medicine practices, their own writing system, and their influence on Greek knowledge. In ancient Egypt, medical practices were a combination
        of religious beliefs, empirical knowledge, and practical applications. As the Egyptians had an extensive knowledge of the properties of herbs
        and botanicals, herbal remedies were a common practice in Egyptian medicinal treatments. They were also often accompanied by religious rituals
        and prayers for full effect as they believed that all diseases had both a natural and a supernatural cause. In addition, they were also
        capable of performing basic surgical procedures such as treating wounds and broken bones and performing dental procedures. This knowledge
        contributed to the progression of medicine and would spread across neighbouring countries, eventually contributing to the rational approaches
        future European countries would take toward health practices. The ancient Egyptians developed one of the first writing systems in history, the
        hieroglyphics. This made it possible for complex ideas to be conveyed through written language for the first time. The hieroglyphics would
        become a model for future writing systems, laying the foundation for the development of human communication, and indirectly creating the
        groundwork for rational discourse. Significant Greek scholars whose work was heavily studied by future European scholars, such as Herodotus
        and Pythagoras would travel to Egypt to exchange ideas which would eventually lead to Egypt's indirect transmission of ideas. In addition,
        Greek mathematicians were heavily influenced by Egyptian mathematics, particularly geometry, and would develop their works by building on
        earlier Egyptian knowledge. Hence, Egyptian knowledge would become the intellectual foundation of many works that contributed to the
        development of rational thinking in Europe.

      <h2>The Ancient Hebrews 3761 B.C.E</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient Hebrews are most well known for their religion Judaism and the religions that stemmed out of it, Christianity and Islam. According
        to the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew people were formed in 1900 BCE when their first patriarch Abraham, led them out of Mesopotamia to become
        wandering herders. It was during this time that Abraham agreed to the Covenant, a promise with the God Yahweh, which states that Yahweh shall
        grant the Hebrews a land of peace and prosperity in exchange for their devotion and worship. However, while the Hebrews were devoted to
        Yahweh, they would still believe in the existence of other gods during this time as it wasn't until several centuries later that they would
        condemn polytheism. It was during a time now remembered as the Prophetic Movement where prophets would denounce the existence of other gods
        and call for the Hebrews to exclusively worship Yahweh which would lead the Hebrews to true monotheism. This made the Hebrews one of the first
        civilizations to practice monotheism, laying the foundation for people to begin questioning polytheistic beliefs and superstitions. Sometime
        after establishing the Covenant, their leader at the time, Moses, would modify it into the 10 Commandments which included specific rules on
        behaviour the Hebrews were to abide by for guarantee of prosperity from Yahweh. This differed from the religions at the time where the gods
        would be indifferent to the ethical conduct of its people so long as the proper rituals and prayers were performed. An important difference
        between Yahweh and the other anthropomorphic gods of the time was that Yahweh only punished people who defied him. The concept of having one
        rational god encouraged the Hebrews to seek understanding through reason. Many religious Hebrew texts emphasized the importance of moral and
        ethical responsibilities and promoted critical thinking. This would heavily influence future European philosophers to seek a rational outlook.
        In addition, Hebrew teaching would often promote justice, fairness, and the idea of individual rights which European societies would
        eventually use to form the framework of their legal systems.

      <h2>The Ancient Greeks 800 B.C.E - 146 B.C.E</h2>
      <p>
        During the Hellenic Age, the ancient Greeks significantly contributed to the development of rational thought in Europe through their
        contributions in philosophy, science, literature, and democracy. Ancient Greek philosophy placed great emphasis on reason and inquiry,
        promoting the idea of having a logical observation of the world. Philosophers such as Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato encouraged people to seek
        knowledge through critical thinking and logical reasoning rather than attributing it to the whim of gods. This would form the basis of Western
        philosophy and set the foundation for rational thought in Europe. Due to the philosophical encouragement of scientific inquiry, early Greek
        scientists were able to make significant contributions to various fields through their empirical observations. Many of these contributions
        such as the first astronomical models, the concept of mathematical proofs, and medical treatises would form the groundwork of today’s modern
        sciences. Even through literature, Greek writers such as Homer, Aeschylus, and Sophocles promoted critical thinking and rational reflection on
        human nature and ethical and social issues. They did this through their works which explored the complexity of human emotions, moral dilemmas,
        and social and political issues of their time. The flourishing city-state of Athens became one of the first societies to experiment with
        direct democracy where male citizens were able to participate directly in the decision-making processes of the state. This democracy's
        governance encouraged making laws based on reason and collective interests, valuing the voice of individuals. This democratic government
        represented a significant step towards the concept of citizen participation. The legacy of the Hellenistic Age continues to have a lasting
        influence on Western civilization. These ideas of the Ancient Greeks heavily influenced the Romans, were revived and explored by the Europeans
        during the Renaissance, and significantly contributed to the Enlightenment.

      <h2>The Romans 753 B.C.E</h2>
      <p>
        The ancient Romans were a civilization originating from the city of Rome in Italy. Their history was divided into three periods, the kingdom,
        the Roman Republic, and the Roman Empire. Not much is known about the kingdom era but according to legends, it was during this time period
        when Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus and was ruled as a monarchy. The Roman Republic was formed when the monarchy was overthrown and
        replaced by a representative democracy. New political offices and institutes were created along with a system that ensured the elected
        officials would be kept in check. Eventually, the Roman Republic would turn into the Roman Empire and become an absolute monarchy under the
        governance of Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. It was during this time that Rome would reach its peak and enter a state of relative peace
        and stability, allowing for the rise in cultural, economic, and architectural developments. The ancient Romans significantly contributed to
        Europe's transition towards a more rational outlook through their legal system and governance, historical inquiry, and spread of ideas. The
        Roman Republic established a complex legal system that emphasized rational principles such as equality before the law, consistency, and the
        rights of citizens. They created a set of laws named the Twelve Tables that would later become the basis of European legal systems. In
        addition, the Roman Republic also had a democratic government where all the officials who governed the state were elected and were kept in
        line by a system of checks and balances. This would create the foundation for how democratic political systems would be formed in modern
        societies. Roman historians approached history with a rational mindset, acknowledging the importance of examining the sources, evaluating the
        evidence, and interpreting the historical events. In addition, historians would also seek out primary sources such as official documents and
        eyewitness accounts to create a credible narrative. Influenced by Greek teachings, the Romans aimed to provide a balanced perspective that
        considered the different perspectives and analyzed the causes and effects of each event. This systematic approach to historical inquiry
        encouraged future historians to rationally analyze historical events, contributing to the development of historiography. Due to the Romans'
        vast empire, they were able to exchange ideas and cultures across regions. Including rational concepts which caused a broader acceptance of
        rational principles, contributing to the spread of rational thought and outlook in Europe.

      <h2>Christianity 325 B.C.E</h2>
      <p>
        Christianity is an abrahamic religion born around the primary belief that Jesus Christ is the messiah & son of god. Though the religion has
        garnered many different sects, orders, and several main groups including Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodoxy, and Restorationism. All of
        them involve the common throughline of belief in god through Jesus and some form of bible. Whilst the words that were actually said by Jesus
        include a lot of beliefs through reason, a fair majority of what he said was words of faith, and Christianity throughout the years became the
        biggest influence of faith in the European world.

      <h2>Feudalism/Medieval Ages 1200 B.C.E</h2>
      <p>
        The medieval period can be quantified timeline-wise into the rise & fall of the Byzantine empire. Beginning in 476 when the western roman
        empire fell, and ending ~3-50 years after the Byzantine's loss of constantinople, and thus, the empire. During this period there was a
        significant loss of reason in Europe, though other sections of the world (Specifically Asia) were not as heavily affected by this era. (Reason
        does not mean technology, and there were actually significant developments in this era) It's difficult to overstate how much church dominated
        and abused its power during this time and this was also when Feudalism was the usual way lords and kings reigned over their land. With the
        population separated into 4 different classes, (commoners, knights, clergy/nobles, and monarchs) life was painful, and the only solace people
        found was faith in god and belief that they would go to heaven. This is thus the period of the most significant faith and the least reason.

      <h2>The Bubonic Plague 1347</h2>
      <p>
        The bubonic plague (Also known as the black death, at the time) was the most significant spread of a fatal disease in human history, and the
        death toll was to the point where it's possible that ½ of people died. (Other estimates place this at ⅓, or ⅕, but it's generally hard to
        determine.) This event took place from roughly 1346-1353, and was probably the time period for the most faith over reason in the world. As the
        already superstitious and devout people of Europe then started to believe the plague was an act of god, almost entirely leaving reason out of
        the equation. Through this plague, the church probably got to the most powerful it ever had been, and the Reign of feudalism was even stronger
        during this time. The plague still existed after these years and into today, technically, but it was much less significant then

      <h2>The Renaissance 1300s</h2>
      <p>
        The period that moved into the age of enlightenment, the Renaissance was a movement by writers, philosophers, scientists, and poets to embrace
        reason over faith. Many people all over europe began to question the church's and monarch's legitimacy, and unrest grew into critical
        documents and writings that are still used today. People like Thomas Hobbes, Voltaire, and Rousseau, began to write in opposition or at least
        better management of the Monarch's reign. This era is probably one of the biggest increases in reason there is, suddenly jumping from entirely
        faith to slightly more reason than faith in the average populace. Many ideas and theories are still held from this era, and those that don't
        are still the building blocks for modern science today.

      <h2>The Reformation 1517</h2>
      <p>
        The Reformation was a significant religious and social movement that occurred in the 16th century, primarily in Germany where the famous
        figure Martin Luther, started the call for change. It aimed to reform the Roman Catholic Church which had overwhelming power, which sometimes
        even rivalled the king. Martin Luther, is credited with starting the reformation by nailing his 95 theses to a church door in Germany. This
        would be a huge movement against the church that would later spread towards England and further west to the Americas. The 95 theses called for
        free access to the bible, as many at the time were written in Latin, which only “educated” clergy could read. This would allow the average
        commoner to gain access to the bible. Additionally, the reformation challenged the idea of one single religion by allowing the idea of
        Religious Pluralism which opened the world up to Protestants and many of its variations. Altogether, the Reformation was more towards
        reasoning however, it still contained the idea that religion was important making it a inbetween of Age of Reason and Age of Religion

      <h2>The Scientific Revolution 1543 - 1687</h2>
      <p>
        The scientific revolution was a period of significant change in the scientific method and reasoning. It took place during the 16th and 17th
        centuries. It replaced the old scientific view on natural sciences which was based on the Ancient Greeks which had dominated the field for
        around 2000 years. During this time, people began to ask more questions about the world around them which led to more answers as people began
        to find answers to their questions. While seeking for answers, many began to use the same method inorder to get similar answers, which led to
        the development of the scientific method which we still use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scientific Revolution challenged traditional Christian beliefs about the origins of the universe and the natural world, leading to a
        conflict between Science and Religion. However, it is important to remember that religion and science can exist at the same time and that one
        is not “better” than the other. For example, Nicolaus Copernicus served the Catholic Church as an official but still had the freedom to
        conduct scientific research at the same time which led him to create the heliocentric system. While religion played a role in shaping
        scientific thought, it was reason and physical evidence that drove the scientific revolution.

      <h2>The Enlightenment 17th-18th</h2>
      <p>
        The Enlightenment was an intellectual movement of the late 17th and 18th centuries, promoting reason, individualism, and the application of
        rational thinking to improve society and knowledge. One significant figure is Montesquieu. He suggests that there should be a separation of
        the Church and state, suggesting that we should have levels of government. The separation of government is still seen today in modern
        representative democracies around the world. Other philosophers; John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Thomas Hobbes, and Voltaire, all promoted
        the idea of the nature of humans. Hobbes believed that all humans were born evil, while opposite to him, Rousseau believed that all humans are
        born good and that the environment eventually corrupts them. However in both cases, they both push for a social contract. A social contract is
        like a constitution, where the citizens get rights and are protected by the ones who they serve, ie the king/queen. While Locke believed
        people are born like a blank slate (Tabula Rasa) he is more known for his idea of natural rights which defines that all men have rights when
        they were born. This is now seen in many places such in the modern day; Declaration of Human Rights. We see other philosophers such as Adam
        Smith, The Father of Capitalism. Voltaire, who created the idea of free speech. And Diderot, the creator of the encyclopedie. All these men
        have the same in common. They all challenged the church and its religious teachings in some way or another. This age was a movement towards
        reasoning as many people began to question the church’s teachings. As people become more and more oppressed, many people begin to doubt, and
        with that, many people begin to demand for change which leads people thinking about a new way of life. So, I would put the Enlightenment below
        the line as it figures began to challenge the church.
